These are pieces of code and algorithms I have implemented which have helped me solve some competitive programming challenges. Feel free to use them.

String Arithmetic
==================
string_arithmetic.cpp
This is a C++ implementation that handles numbers that are bigger than 64 bits long. It works by storing the numbers
as C++ strings. Custom functions have been defined that perform basic arithmetic operations like additon and subtraction
on the given numbers.

The following functions have been implemented for string arithmetic in string_operations.cpp:

1. add = adds the numbers in the two strings to produce a new string
2. sub = subtracts the numbers in the two strings
3. divde_by_2 = halves the value of the number in the given string
4. naive_multiply = grade school multiplication algo to multiply two string numbers
5. multiply = Karatsuba multiplication implementation to give the product of two string numbers
