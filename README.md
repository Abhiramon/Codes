These are pieces of code and algorithms I have implemented which have helped me solve some competitive programming challenges. Feel free to use them.

Numbers as Strings
==================
This is a C++ implementation that handles numbers that are bigger than 64 bits long. It works by storing the numbers
as C++ strings. Custom functions have been defined that perform basic arithmetic operations like additon and subtraction
on the given numbers.

Coming Soon - 
A multiplicaton function that uses the Karatsuba fast multiplication algorithm to multiply two string numbers. Since these functions are to be used for extremely large numbers, Karatsuba algorithm should provide significantly faster computations than the generic grade-school algorithm which involves n*m single digit mulitplications.
